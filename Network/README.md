## RST
TCP RST is a mechanism used to abruptly terminate a connection or respond to packets for a non-existent connection. It involves setting the RST flag in the TCP header and results in the immediate termination of the connection and cleanup of associated resources. Applications must handle this event gracefully to maintain robustness.
