Below is a breakdown of how `git pull` and `git merge` work, and what each of your example invocations does (or tries to do). At their core:

* **`git pull`** is shorthand for “fetch from a remote → merge into my current branch.”
* **`git merge`** takes one or more commits (usually branches) and merges them into your current branch.

---

## 1. `git pull`

Syntax:

```bash
git pull [<remote> [<branch>]]
```

* `<remote>`: the name of a remote repository (e.g. `origin`, `upstream`).
* `<branch>`: the name of the branch on that remote to fetch *and* merge.

### 1.1 `git pull`

* **What it does**

  1. `git fetch origin` (assuming your `origin` remote is configured)
  2. `git merge origin/‹current-branch›` into your local `‹current-branch›`

* **When to use**
  You’re on, say, `feature/login` and you just want the very latest commits from `origin/feature/login` merged into your local copy.

---

### 1.2 `git pull <branch1>`

* **What this actually means**
  Git treats the first argument as a *remote name*, not as a branch.
  So it’s equivalent to:

  ```bash
  git pull <remote-name>=<branch1>  # usually fails unless you have a remote called branch1
  ```
* **Common confusion**
  If you meant “pull branch1 from origin,” you must specify the remote first:

  ```bash
  git pull origin branch1
  ```

  Otherwise Git will look for a remote named `branch1` (and error if none exists).

---

### 1.3 `git pull origin`

* **What it does**

  1. `git fetch origin`
  2. `git merge origin/‹current-branch›`

* **Difference vs. plain `git pull`**
  If your default remote is already `origin`, it behaves identically to `git pull`.
  Use this form if you have multiple remotes and want to be explicit.

---

### 1.4 `git pull origin <branch1>`

* **What it does**

  1. `git fetch origin branch1:origin/branch1`
  2. `git merge origin/branch1` into your *current* branch

* **Use case**
  You’re on `develop` but want to pull & merge in whatever’s on `origin/branch1`.

---

## 2. `git merge`

Syntax:

```bash
git merge [<commit>…]
```

You run this *in* the branch you want to merge *into*.

---

### 2.1 `git merge <branch1>`

* **What it does**
  Merges the tip of `branch1` into your current branch.
  Git will:

  1. Find the latest common ancestor of `HEAD` (current) and `branch1`
  2. Generate a merge commit combining both lines of history (unless it can fast‑forward)

* **Example**

  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  git merge feature/login
  ```

  incorporates the work from `feature/login` into `develop`.

---

### 2.2 `git merge <branch1> <branch2>`

* **What it does**
  Merges *both* `branch1` and `branch2` into your current branch, in one go.
  This is just a shorthand for:

  ```bash
  git merge branch1
  git merge branch2
  ```

  except Git will try to do them in a single series of merge steps, potentially saving you repeat conflict resolution.

* **When to use**
  Rarely. Mostly when you have two independent lines of work you want in one merge commit:

  ```bash
  git checkout integration
  git merge feature/a feature/b
  ```

## TL;DR Cheat‑sheet

| Command                         | Action                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `git pull`                      | Fetch + merge from `origin/<current‑branch>`                                   |
| `git pull origin`               | Same as above, but explicit about the remote                                   |
| `git pull origin <branch1>`     | Fetch `origin/branch1`, then merge into *your* current branch                  |
| `git pull <branch1>`            | ❌ Invalid unless you have a remote named `branch1`                             |
| `git merge <branch1>`           | Merge the tip of `branch1` into your *current* branch                          |
| `git merge <branch1> <branch2>` | Merge both `branch1` and `branch2` into your *current* branch in one operation |

### A few extra tips

* If you consistently pull from the same remote branch, you can set an *upstream* with:

  ```bash
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/branch1
  ```

  Then `git pull` alone will know which remote+branch to use.

* When pulling, if you prefer *rebase* instead of merge:

  ```bash
  git pull --rebase origin <branch1>
  ```

  This replays your local commits on top of the fetched ones, keeping a linear history.

* Always check `git remote -v` to see your remote names (usually `origin`).

Hope that clarifies how each form works! Let me know if you need examples of conflict resolution or advanced options.
