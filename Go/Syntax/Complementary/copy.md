The built-in function `**copy(dst, src)**` in Go is used to **copy elements from a source slice to a destination slice**. Let's break down what it does:

**Purpose:**

* **Efficiently copies elements:**  It's a highly optimized way to transfer data between slices in Go.
* **Safe and handles overlaps:** It's designed to be safe even if the source and destination slices overlap in memory.
* **Works with slices of the same type:**  It's primarily intended for copying between slices that have the same element type.

**Arguments:**

* **`dst` (destination slice):**  The slice where elements will be copied *to*.
* **`src` (source slice):** The slice from which elements will be copied *from*.

**Behavior:**

1. **Element-wise copy:** `copy` copies elements one by one from `src` to `dst`.

2. **Number of elements copied:** The number of elements copied is the **minimum** of:
   * `len(dst)` (length of the destination slice)
   * `len(src)` (length of the source slice)   This means `copy` will not go out of bounds on either slice. It will stop copying when it reaches the end of either the source or the destination slice.

3. **No resizing:** `copy` **does not resize** the destination slice. It only overwrites existing elements within the destination slice's current length. If `len(dst)` is less than `len(src)`, only the first `len(dst)` elements from `src` will be copied. If `len(src)` is less than `len(dst)`, only `len(src)` elements will be copied into `dst`, and the remaining elements in `dst` (beyond the copied elements) will be unchanged (whatever was there before).

4. **Overlapping slices:** `copy` handles overlapping source and destination slices correctly. It ensures that even if the slices overlap, the copy operation will produce the expected result without corrupting data.

5. **Element type:** Both `dst` and `src` must be slices of the **same element type** (or implicitly convertible types, like `[]byte` and `string` in some cases).

**Return Value:**

* `copy(dst, src)` returns an `int` value. This integer represents the **number of elements actually copied**. This will be the minimum of `len(dst)` and `len(src)`.

**Example Scenarios:**

**1. Copying a slice to another slice (smaller destination):**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	src := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	dst := make([]int, 3) // Destination slice with length 3

	numCopied := copy(dst, src)

	fmt.Println("Source:", src)
	fmt.Println("Destination:", dst)
	fmt.Println("Elements Copied:", numCopied) // Output: 3 (minimum of len(dst) and len(src))
}
```

**Output:**

```
Source: [1 2 3 4 5]
Destination: [1 2 3]
Elements Copied: 3
```

**2. Copying a slice to another slice (larger destination):**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	src := []int{10, 20, 30}
	dst := make([]int, 5) // Destination slice with length 5

	numCopied := copy(dst, src)

	fmt.Println("Source:", src)
	fmt.Println("Destination:", dst)
	fmt.Println("Elements Copied:", numCopied) // Output: 3 (minimum of len(dst) and len(src))
}
```

**Output:**

```
Source: [10 20 30]
Destination: [10 20 30 0 0] // Remaining elements in dst are zero-initialized
Elements Copied: 3
```

**3. Copying byte slices (common use case):**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	srcBytes := []byte("Hello")
	dstBytes := make([]byte, 10) // Destination byte slice

	numBytesCopied := copy(dstBytes, srcBytes)

	fmt.Println("Source Bytes:", string(srcBytes))
	fmt.Println("Destination Bytes:", string(dstBytes))
	fmt.Println("Bytes Copied:", numBytesCopied)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Source Bytes: Hello
Destination Bytes: Hello     
Bytes Copied: 5
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* `copy` is for copying elements between slices.
* It copies up to the length of the shorter slice.
* It doesn't resize the destination slice.
* It's safe with overlapping slices.
* It returns the number of elements copied.
* Commonly used for byte slice manipulation and general slice data transfer.

In summary, `copy(output, input)` in Go will copy elements from the `input` slice to the `output` slice, up to the length of the shorter slice, and return the number of elements copied. It's a fundamental and efficient function for slice manipulation in Go.
