Okay, let's break down struct tags in Go. They're a powerful feature for adding metadata to struct fields, primarily used for serialization/deserialization, validation, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) interactions.

```
A field declaration may be followed by an optional string literal tag, which becomes an attribute for all the fields in the corresponding field declaration.
```

*   **`A field declaration may be followed by...`**: This refers to the line where you define a field within a struct.
*   **`...an optional string literal tag...`**: The tag is a string literal (text enclosed in backticks: `` ` ``). It's *optional*; you don't have to include a tag for every field.
*   **`...which becomes an attribute for all the fields...`**: The tag applies to the field(s) declared on that line.  If you have multiple fields on one line (like `x, y float64`), the tag applies to *all* of them.
*   **`...in the corresponding field declaration.`**:  Reinforces that the tag belongs to the fields on that specific line.

```
An empty tag string is equivalent to an absent tag.
```

*   **`An empty tag string...`**:  A tag with nothing between the backticks (`` ``).
*   **`...is equivalent to an absent tag.`**:  Having an empty tag is the same as not having a tag at all.  It doesn't add any metadata.

```
The tags are made visible through a reflection interface and take part in type identity for structs but are otherwise ignored.
```

*   **`The tags are made visible through a reflection interface...`**:  The most important part!  Tags are *not* directly accessible in your regular code (like you can't do `myStruct.myField.tag`).  You need to use Go's `reflect` package to access them.  Reflection allows you to inspect types and values at runtime.
*   **`...and take part in type identity for structs...`**:  Two struct types are considered *identical* only if they have the same field names, types, *and* tags.  If the tags are different, the types are different, even if everything else is the same.
*   **`...but are otherwise ignored.`**:  The Go compiler itself doesn't *do* anything with the tags.  They're purely metadata.  It's up to *other* code (like libraries for JSON encoding, database mapping, etc.) to *use* the tags.

**Examples and Explanation**

```go
struct {
	x, y float64 ""  // an empty tag string is like an absent tag
	name string  "any string is permitted as a tag"
	_    [4]byte "ceci n'est pas un champ de structure"
}
```

*   **`x, y float64 ""`**:  `x` and `y` are `float64` fields.  The empty tag (`` ``) is the same as having no tag.
*   **`name string "any string is permitted as a tag"`**: `name` is a `string` field.  The tag is `"any string is permitted as a tag"`.  This demonstrates that the tag can be *any* string, but there are common conventions.
*   **`_ [4]byte "ceci n'est pas un champ de structure"`**: This is a blank identifier (`_`).  Blank identifiers are used when you need to declare a variable (or, in this case, a field) but you don't intend to use it. It is still a field, but it is not accessible. The tag is present but, like the field itself, is effectively ignored unless you specifically look for it using reflection.

```go
// A struct corresponding to a TimeStamp protocol buffer.
// The tag strings define the protocol buffer field numbers;
// they follow the convention outlined by the reflect package.
struct {
	microsec  uint64 `protobuf:"1"`
	serverIP6 uint64 `protobuf:"2"`
}
```

*   **`// A struct corresponding to a TimeStamp protocol buffer.`**:  This comment explains the purpose of the struct.
*   **`// The tag strings define the protocol buffer field numbers;`**:  This is the key.  The tags (`protobuf:"1"`, `protobuf:"2"`) are used by a Protocol Buffers library to map the Go struct fields to the corresponding fields in a Protocol Buffers message.
*   **`// they follow the convention outlined by the reflect package.`**:  While tags can be any string, there are conventions.  The `reflect` package itself doesn't define the *content* of the tags, but it defines *how* to access them.  Libraries (like the Protocol Buffers library) then define their *own* conventions for the tag content.
*   **`microsec uint64 protobuf:"1"`**:  The `microsec` field has the tag `protobuf:"1"`.  This tells the Protocol Buffers library that this field should be mapped to field number 1 in the Protocol Buffers message.
*   **`serverIP6 uint64 protobuf:"2"`**:  The `serverIP6` field has the tag `protobuf:"2"`, mapping it to field number 2.

**Practical Example with `reflect`**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

type User struct {
	ID       int    `json:"id" db:"user_id"`
	Username string `json:"username" db:"user_name"`
	Email    string `json:"email,omitempty" db:"user_email"`
	Age      int    `json:"age,string"` // Convert to string during JSON encoding
	Address  string // No tag
}

func main() {
	userType := reflect.TypeOf(User{})

	for i := 0; i < userType.NumField(); i++ {
		field := userType.Field(i)
		fmt.Printf("Field Name: %s\n", field.Name)
		fmt.Printf("Field Type: %v\n", field.Type)		// Accessing the tags
		jsonTag := field.Tag.Get("json")
		dbTag := field.Tag.Get("db")

		fmt.Printf("JSON Tag: %s\n", jsonTag)
		fmt.Printf("DB Tag: %s\n", dbTag)		// Check if a tag exists
        if jsonTag != "" {
            fmt.Println("  Field has a JSON tag")
        }
        if dbTag != "" {
            fmt.Println("  Field has a DB tag")
        }
        if field.Tag == "" { // Check for an empty or absent tag.
            fmt.Println(" Field has no tag at all.")
        }

		fmt.Println("---")
	}
}
```
