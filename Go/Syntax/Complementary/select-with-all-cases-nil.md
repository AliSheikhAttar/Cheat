Let’s dive into your scenario in Go, where you have a `select` block inside an infinite `for` loop, with two cases corresponding to two channels that are eventually set to `nil`. You’re wondering what happens after both channels become `nil`: does the `select` block halt, or does the `for` loop keep iterating forever? You also suspect that the `select` statement might ignore cases with `nil` channels. Let’s break this down step-by-step and figure out the behavior clearly.

### Understanding the Setup
Imagine you have code like this:

```go
ch1 := make(chan int)
ch2 := make(chan int)

go func() {
    // After some time, set both channels to nil
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    ch1 = nil
    ch2 = nil
}()

for {
    select {
    case <-ch1:
        // Do something with ch1
    case <-ch2:
        // Do something with ch2
    }
}
```

Here, the `for` loop runs indefinitely because it has no condition to terminate. Inside it, there’s a `select` statement with two cases, each attempting to receive from one of the channels (`ch1` and `ch2`). Initially, these channels are valid (unbuffered channels created with `make`), but after some time—say, 1 second—they are both set to `nil` by another goroutine. The question is: what happens to the `select` block and the `for` loop once `ch1` and `ch2` are `nil`?

### How `select` Works in Go
First, let’s recall how a `select` statement operates in Go. The `select` statement allows a goroutine to wait on multiple communication operations (send or receive on channels). Here’s the basic rule:

- **If one or more cases can proceed** (e.g., a channel has data to receive or can accept a send), Go randomly selects one of those ready cases to execute.
- **If no case can proceed**:
  - If there’s a `default` case, it executes immediately.
  - If there’s no `default` case (as in your scenario), the `select` statement **blocks** until at least one case becomes ready.

In your code, there are only two cases and no `default` case, so if neither case can proceed, the `select` statement will block.

### Behavior of `nil` Channels
Now, what happens when a channel is `nil`? In Go:

- **Receiving from a `nil` channel** (e.g., `<-ch1` when `ch1 == nil`) **blocks forever**. It doesn’t panic or return a value; the operation simply never completes.
- **Sending to a `nil` channel** (e.g., `ch1 <- 1` when `ch1 == nil`) **also blocks forever**.

This is distinct from a *closed* channel, where receiving returns the zero value immediately if the channel is empty. A `nil` channel isn’t closed—it’s uninitialized or explicitly set to `nil`, and operations on it are permanently blocked.

In a `select` statement, each case is evaluated. If a case involves an operation that would block forever (like receiving from a `nil` channel), that case is effectively **unselectable**—it can never proceed, so the `select` statement won’t choose it unless there are no other options.

### Applying This to Your Scenario
#### Before Channels Are `nil`
Initially, `ch1` and `ch2` are valid channels. Assuming no data is being sent to them (since your scenario doesn’t mention any senders), the `select` statement blocks, waiting for data on either `ch1` or `ch2`. The `for` loop is stuck in its first iteration because the `select` hasn’t completed yet. This is normal behavior for unbuffered channels with no active senders.

#### After Both Channels Are Set to `nil`
After the goroutine sets `ch1 = nil` and `ch2 = nil`, the `select` statement in the current iteration of the `for` loop (or the next one, if it somehow completed previously) evaluates its cases:

- **Case `<-ch1`**: Since `ch1` is `nil`, this receive operation would block forever if executed. Thus, this case cannot proceed.
- **Case `<-ch2`**: Since `ch2` is `nil`, this receive operation would also block forever. This case cannot proceed either.

With both channels `nil`, neither case can ever be selected. Since there’s no `default` case to fall back on, the `select` statement has no viable options. According to Go’s rules, when no case in a `select` can proceed and there’s no `default`, the entire `select` statement **blocks indefinitely**.

### Impact on the `for` Loop
The `for` loop is infinite (`for {}`), meaning it’s designed to iterate forever *if* each iteration completes. However, each iteration contains the `select` statement. Once both channels are `nil`, the `select` statement in that iteration blocks forever. Because the `select` never completes:

- The current iteration of the `for` loop doesn’t finish.
- The loop doesn’t proceed to the next iteration.

So, the `for` loop doesn’t “iterate forever” in the sense of repeatedly executing the `select` block over and over. Instead, it gets **stuck** in the iteration where the `select` encounters both channels as `nil`.

### Addressing Your Suspicion
You mentioned thinking that “the `select` statement ignores cases where the corresponding channel is `nil`.” You’re partially right: a `select` statement doesn’t *select* a case with a `nil` channel because that operation would block forever. It’s as if that case is skipped or disabled for selection. This is a common idiom in Go—to disable a case in a `select`, set its channel to `nil`. However:

- If *some* cases have non-`nil` channels, the `select` proceeds with those.
- If *all* cases involve `nil` channels (as in your scenario), and there’s no `default`, the `select` has no cases to choose from, so it blocks forever.

It’s not that the `select` “ignores” the cases in the sense of skipping the entire statement—it evaluates them, finds no selectable cases, and then blocks.

### What “Halts” Means
Your question asks whether “the `select` block halts” or “the `for` statement iterates forever.” In programming, “halts” could mean “terminates” or “stops progressing.” Here, the `select` block doesn’t terminate the program—it **blocks indefinitely**, pausing execution at that point. The goroutine running the `for` loop (likely the main goroutine) is stuck, and if this is the only goroutine, the program continues running but makes no progress.

### The Final Answer
After both channels are set to `nil`:

- The `select` block **halts**, meaning it blocks forever and doesn’t allow execution to proceed beyond it.
- The `for` loop does **not iterate forever**—it’s trapped in the iteration where the `select` blocks, unable to continue.

So, to directly answer your question: **the `select` block halts**. The program doesn’t crash or terminate, but the `select` statement stops the `for` loop from iterating further by blocking indefinitely.
