If the source code represents a character as two code points, such as a combining form involving an accent and a letter, the result will be an error if placed in a rune literal (it is not a single code point), and will appear as two code points if placed in a string literal.

Go's `rune` type represents a single Unicode code point.  If a character is represented by *two* code points (like a base character and a combining accent), a rune literal won't work, but a string literal will.

Let's break down the example and clarify what "accent" means in this context:

**What's an Accent (Combining Diacritical Mark)?**

In Unicode, many accented characters (like á, é, ç, etc.) can be represented in two ways:

1. **Precomposed:** A single code point representing the entire character (e.g., 'á' is one code point).
2. **Decomposed:** Two code points: one for the base character (e.g., 'a') and one for the combining accent (e.g., the acute accent ´).  These combining accents are called "combining diacritical marks."

The decomposed form is what the example is talking about.  It's important because some systems or fonts might not have precomposed characters for everything, and the combining approach allows for more flexibility.

**Go Example**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Example using precomposed characters (single code points)
    runeLiteral := 'á' // Precomposed 'á' (one code point)
    stringLiteral := "á" // Precomposed 'á' in a string (one code point)

    fmt.Printf("Rune literal: %c (code point: %U)\n", runeLiteral, runeLiteral)
    fmt.Printf("String literal: %s (code points: ", stringLiteral)
    for _, r := range stringLiteral {
        fmt.Printf("%U ", r)
    }
    fmt.Println(")")


    // Example using decomposed characters (two code points)
    decomposedString := "a\u0301" // 'a' + combining acute accent (\u0301)

    // runeLiteralDecomposed := 'a\u0301' // This will cause a compile-time error: invalid character literal (more than one character)
    stringLiteralDecomposed := "a\u0301"

    fmt.Printf("\nString literal (decomposed): %s (code points: ", stringLiteralDecomposed)
    for _, r := range stringLiteralDecomposed {
        fmt.Printf("%U ", r)
    }
    fmt.Println(")")

    fmt.Println("Length of precomposed string:", len(stringLiteral)) // 1 (one code point)
    fmt.Println("Length of decomposed string:", len(stringLiteralDecomposed)) // 2 (two code points)

}
```
- output
```bash
Rune literal: á (code point: U+00E1)
String literal: á (code points: U+00E1 )

String literal (decomposed): á (code points: U+0061 U+0301 )
Length of precomposed string: 2
Length of decomposed string: 3
```

**Explanation of the Code and Output:**

1. **Precomposed:** The first examples use the precomposed 'á'.  Both the rune literal and the string literal work fine because it's a single code point (2 code point in string).

2. **Decomposed:** The `decomposedString` uses `a\u0301`.  `\u0301` is the Unicode escape sequence for the combining acute accent.

3. **Rune Literal Error:**  The commented-out line `runeLiteralDecomposed := 'a\u0301'` demonstrates the error.  You *cannot* put two code points into a rune literal.  Go expects a single code point.

4. **String Literal Success:** The `stringLiteralDecomposed` works fine because strings in Go can hold multiple code points.  When you iterate over the decomposed string, you'll see two code points printed: one for 'a' and one for the combining acute accent.

5. **Length Difference:** `len(stringLiteral)` returns 2 (two code point), whereas `len(stringLiteralDecomposed)` returns 3 (three code points), clearly showing the difference between the two representations.

**Key Takeaway:**

* `rune` literals are for single code points.
* Strings can hold sequences of code points.  If a character is represented by a base character and a combining accent, it will be two code points in the string.  This is important when working with text that might contain decomposed characters.  You need to be aware that what appears to be a single visual character might actually be represented by multiple code points.
