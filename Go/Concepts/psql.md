Yes, that's correct! By "PostgreSQL server," I mean the **PostgreSQL service** running on your machine. Let me explain this in detail:

---

psql is a command-line interface (CLI) client for PostgreSQL. It is a tool that allows you to interact with a PostgreSQL database server from the terminal or command prompt.

In simple terms, psql is the official PostgreSQL interactive terminal used to:

Connect to a PostgreSQL server.
Execute SQL queries and commands.
Manage databases, users, roles, and other database objects.
Perform administrative tasks, such as backups and troubleshooting.

### What is the PostgreSQL Server?

The **PostgreSQL server** is the main process (a.k.a. the "daemon") that manages your PostgreSQL database system. It is responsible for:
1. Listening for incoming client connections (e.g., from `psql`, applications, or other tools).
2. Managing the database files and performing read/write operations.
3. Executing SQL queries and returning results.
4. Handling authentication and access control.

When you install PostgreSQL, it sets up this server as a **system service** that runs in the background. This is referred to as the **PostgreSQL service** on your machine.

### How the PostgreSQL Service Works

1. **Starting the Service**:
   - The PostgreSQL server is started as a system service when your machine boots up (if configured to start automatically).
   - On Ubuntu, the service is managed by `systemd` or `init.d`.

   You can control the service using the following commands:
   ```bash
   # Check the status of the PostgreSQL service
   sudo service postgresql status

   # Start the PostgreSQL service
   sudo service postgresql start

   # Stop the PostgreSQL service
   sudo service postgresql stop

   # Restart the PostgreSQL service
   sudo service postgresql restart
   ```

2. **Listening for Connections**:
   - The PostgreSQL server listens for connections on:
     - A **Unix domain socket** (default: `/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432`), which is used for local connections.
     - A **TCP/IP port** (default: `5432`), which is used for remote connections.

   You can check if the server is listening by running:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulnp | grep postgres
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5432          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1234/postgres
   ```

3. **Managing Database Files**:
   - The PostgreSQL server stores all database files in a **data directory** (e.g., `/var/lib/postgresql/14/main`).
   - This directory is owned by the `postgres` system user, and only the PostgreSQL server process can access it.

### What Happens When You Run `psql`?

When you run `psql`, it tries to connect to the **PostgreSQL server process** (the service running in the background). Here's how it works:

1. **Client-Server Model**:
   - `psql` is a client program that communicates with the PostgreSQL server.
   - The server is the backend process that manages the database and executes SQL queries.

2. **Connection Attempt**:
   - `psql` sends a connection request to the PostgreSQL server.
   - If the server is running and listening on the expected socket or port, the connection is established.
   - If the server is not running, you'll see an error like:
     ```
     psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directory
     ```

3. **Authentication**:
   - The PostgreSQL server authenticates the client (e.g., `psql`) based on the rules in the `pg_hba.conf` file.
   - If authentication succeeds, the client is connected to the database.

### Why Does It Matter If the PostgreSQL Service is Running?

The PostgreSQL service (or server) must be running for you to interact with your databases. If it's not running, no client (including `psql`) can connect to it. This is why you see errors like "No such file or directory" or "Connection refused" when the service is stopped.

---

### How to Check if PostgreSQL Service is Running?

1. **Using `service` Command**:
   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql status
   ```
   Example output if it's running:
   ```
   ‚óè postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
        Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
        Active: active (exited) since Tue 2025-01-31 10:00:00 UTC; 5min ago
   ```

2. **Using `ps` Command**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep postgres
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   postgres  1234  0.0  0.2 325784 21792 ?   Ss   10:00   0:00 /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/14/main
   postgres  1235  0.0  0.1 325784 21792 ?   Ss   10:00   0:00 postgres: checkpointer
   postgres  1236  0.0  0.1 325784 21792 ?   Ss   10:00   0:00 postgres: background writer
   postgres  1237  0.0  0.1 325784 21792 ?   Ss   10:00   0:00 postgres: walwriter
   ```

3. **Using `netstat` to Check Listening Ports**:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulnp | grep postgres
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5432          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1234/postgres
   ```

### Why Do You Need the `postgres` User?

- The `postgres` system user is the default owner of the PostgreSQL service and its files.
- By default, only the `postgres` system user has permission to interact with the PostgreSQL service directly (e.g., to run `psql` or manage the database).

When you log in as the `postgres` user and run `psql`, it works because:
1. The `postgres` system user is mapped to the `postgres` database role.
2. The PostgreSQL server allows the `postgres` user to connect using **peer authentication** (configured in `pg_hba.conf`).

If you're not logged in as the `postgres` user, you need to:
- Explicitly specify the username when running `psql`:
  ```bash
  psql -U postgres
  ```
- Or create a PostgreSQL role for your current system user.

---

### Summary

- The **PostgreSQL server** is the service running in the background on your machine, managing databases and listening for connections.
- The `psql` command is a client that connects to the PostgreSQL server to interact with databases.
- When you log in as the `postgres` user and run `psql`, it works because the `postgres` user has full access to the server and databases by default.
- If the PostgreSQL service is not running, `psql` cannot connect, and you'll see errors like "No such file or directory." Always ensure the PostgreSQL service is running before trying to connect.
