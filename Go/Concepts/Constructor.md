### Key Points
- Go does not have traditional constructors like Java or C++, but uses factory functions for initialization.
- Factory functions, often named `NewType`, create and initialize structs with validation and error handling.
- Direct struct initialization is possible, but factory functions offer better encapsulation and control.

### What Are Constructors in Go?

In Go, constructors are not built into the language as they are in some other programming languages. Instead, Go relies on **factory functions** to create and initialize instances of structs. These functions act like constructors by setting up the struct with initial values and ensuring itâ€™s in a valid state.

For example, you might define a struct like this:
```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```
Then, create a factory function:
```go
func NewPerson(name string, age int) *Person {
    return &Person{Name: name, Age: age}
}
```
This function initializes a `Person` and returns a pointer to it, similar to how constructors work elsewhere.

### Why Use Factory Functions?

While you can initialize structs directly (e.g., `p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}`), factory functions offer advantages:
- **Validation**: They can check inputs, like ensuring dimensions are positive in a `Rectangle` struct.
- **Encapsulation**: They hide internal details, especially for private fields.
- **Error Handling**: They can return errors if initialization fails, which direct initialization cannot.

For instance, a `Rectangle` factory might look like:
```go
func NewRectangle(w, h float64) (*Rectangle, error) {
    if w <= 0 || h <= 0 {
        return nil, errors.New("dimensions must be positive")
    }
    return &Rectangle{width: w, height: h}, nil
}
```
This ensures the rectangle is always valid, which is an unexpected benefit for ensuring code reliability.
