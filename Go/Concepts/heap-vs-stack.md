Let’s dive into your questions about memory allocation in Go and the differences between stack and heap. I’ll address each part of your query step by step, ensuring everything is clear and comprehensive.

### Do `make` and `new` in Go Allocate on the Heap, While Others Depend on Escape Analysis?

Yes, in Go, we can indeed say that **`make`** and **`new`** allocate memory on the **heap**, while other allocations are determined by **escape analysis**.

- **`make`**:
  - **Purpose**: Used to create slices, maps, and channels.
  - **Behavior**: It initializes these data structures (e.g., setting up an underlying array for a slice or a hash table for a map) and allocates memory for them.
  - **Why the Heap?**: These types are dynamic and often need to persist beyond the current function’s scope or be shared across goroutines. To ensure their lifetime isn’t tied to a single stack frame, Go allocates them on the heap.

- **`new`**:
  - **Purpose**: Allocates memory for any type and returns a pointer to a zero-initialized value.
  - **Behavior**: It’s a general-purpose allocation function that always returns a pointer.
  - **Why the Heap?**: Since it returns a pointer, the memory must reside on the heap to remain valid after the function returns. If it were on the stack, the memory would be deallocated when the stack frame is popped, leaving a dangling pointer.

- **Other Allocations**:
  - **Examples**: Local variables like `x := 42` or structs declared without `new` or `make`.
  - **Behavior**: For these, Go’s compiler uses **escape analysis** to decide where to allocate memory:
    - **Stack**: If the variable doesn’t “escape” the function—meaning it’s not returned, stored in a global variable, or referenced outside its scope—it’s allocated on the stack. This is efficient because stack memory is automatically cleaned up when the function exits.
    - **Heap**: If the variable escapes (e.g., it’s returned as a pointer or assigned to a global), it’s allocated on the heap to ensure it remains accessible.

**Conclusion**: **`make`** and **`new`** consistently allocate on the heap due to their design and purpose, while other variables’ allocation (stack or heap) hinges on escape analysis performed by the compiler.

### Why Is the Stack Faster Than the Heap?

The stack is faster than the heap because of how memory is managed in each:

- **Stack Allocation**:
  - **Mechanism**: The stack uses a single pointer, called the stack pointer, to manage memory.
  - **Process**: When a function is called, the stack pointer moves to reserve space for a new stack frame containing local variables. When the function returns, the pointer moves back, instantly reclaiming that space.
  - **Speed**: This is just simple pointer arithmetic—adding or subtracting a fixed offset. There’s no searching or tracking involved, making it extremely fast.
  - **No Overhead**: The stack doesn’t require garbage collection or complex bookkeeping.

- **Heap Allocation**:
  - **Mechanism**: The heap manages memory with more sophisticated data structures, like free lists, to track available blocks.
  - **Process**: Allocating memory involves finding a suitable free block, which can take time. In Go, the runtime also periodically runs a **garbage collector** to reclaim unused heap memory, adding further overhead.
  - **Speed**: These operations are slower because they’re more complex than stack pointer adjustments and may involve runtime checks or pauses.

**Conclusion**: The stack’s simplicity—relying on predictable pointer movements—makes it faster than the heap, which requires searching, allocation tracking, and garbage collection.

### Why Must Sizes in the Stack Be Static?

Sizes in the stack must be **static** (known at compile time) due to how the stack operates:

- **Fixed Stack Frame Size**:
  - **Requirement**: When a function is called, the compiler allocates a stack frame with enough space for all local variables. To do this, it must know the exact size of each variable at compile time.
  - **Why?**: The stack pointer moves by a fixed amount to reserve this space. If sizes were dynamic (determined at runtime), the compiler couldn’t predict how much space to allocate, risking stack overflows or wasted memory.

- **LIFO Order**:
  - **Behavior**: The stack follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure. Frames are added when functions are called and removed when they return, in strict order.
  - **Implication**: Dynamic sizes could complicate this order, as the runtime would need to adjust frames unpredictably, undermining the stack’s efficiency and simplicity.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - **Advantage**: Static sizes allow the compiler to generate precise instructions for adjusting the stack pointer by fixed amounts. This avoids runtime calculations or resizing, keeping stack operations fast and efficient.

**Note**: In Go, each goroutine has its own stack (starting small, e.g., 2 KB, and growing as needed up to a limit like 1 MB). While the stack itself can grow dynamically, the size of variables within each frame must still be static for the reasons above.

**Conclusion**: Static sizes ensure predictable memory allocation, maintain the stack’s LIFO structure, and optimize performance by enabling compile-time planning.

### Summary

- **Allocation in Go**: **`make`** and **`new`** always allocate on the heap, while other variables are allocated on the stack or heap based on escape analysis.
- **Stack vs. Heap Speed**: The stack is faster because it uses simple pointer arithmetic, avoiding the heap’s complex allocation and garbage collection overhead.
- **Static Stack Sizes**: Sizes must be static to allow the compiler to allocate fixed stack frames, preserve LIFO order, and maintain performance.
