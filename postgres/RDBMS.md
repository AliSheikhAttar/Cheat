# RDBMS
An **RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System) is a type of database system that organizes data into structured **tables**, where each table consists of rows and columns. These tables are connected through **relationships** based on common fields, such as a "Student ID" linking a "Students" table to a "Classes" table in a school database. 

It uses **SQL** (Structured Query Language) to efficiently manage and manipulate data, supporting operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records. Key features include:

- **Data Integrity**: Constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) ensure data remains accurate and consistent.
- **Transactions**: Atomic operations maintain consistency, even across multiple steps.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Optimized querying through relationships and indexing.

Popular examples of RDBMS include **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Microsoft SQL Server**, and **Oracle Database**. It’s widely used for applications needing structured data storage and complex querying capabilities.

When it comes to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), several stand out due to their widespread adoption, unique features, and specific use cases. Below, I’ll outline some of the most famous RDBMS—MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, SQLite, and MariaDB—along with their pros, cons, and key features, followed by a comparison.
