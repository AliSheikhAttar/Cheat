# ORM
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm instead of writing raw SQL queries. It acts as a bridge between a programming language (like Python, Java, or JavaScript) and a relational database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).

### How ORM Works:
- ORM converts database tables into classes and rows into objects.
- Developers interact with the database using methods and attributes rather than SQL queries.
- The ORM library translates these operations into SQL statements automatically.

### Benefits of ORM:
- **Reduces Boilerplate Code**: No need to write repetitive SQL queries.
- **Increases Maintainability**: Changes to the database schema can be managed through code.
- **Enhances Security**: Helps prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Improves Portability**: Makes it easier to switch between different database systems.

### Popular ORM Libraries:
- **Python**: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM
- **Java**: Hibernate
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Sequelize, TypeORM
- **PHP**: Eloquent (Laravel)
