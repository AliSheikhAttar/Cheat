# URI vs URL
The terms **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) and **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in the context of web and internet technologies. Here's a detailed explanation of the differences:

---

### **1. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**

A **URI** is a general term that refers to a string of characters used to uniquely identify a resource on the internet or elsewhere. The key point is that a URI can identify a resource by **name**, **location**, or **both**.

- A URI **can be a URL**, but it can also be something else (e.g., a URN).
- Think of a URI as the broader concept that encompasses different ways of identifying resources.

#### **Types of URIs:**
1. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** Identifies a resource **by its location** (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2. **URN (Uniform Resource Name):** Identifies a resource **by its name** (e.g., `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0`).

#### **Examples of URIs:**
- `https://example.com/resource` (URL)
- `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0` (URN)

### **2. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**

A **URL** is a specific type of URI that provides the **location** of a resource on the internet. It tells you **where** the resource is located and often how to access it (via a protocol like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.).

#### **Key Characteristics of URLs:**
- A URL always includes a scheme (protocol), such as `http`, `https`, or `ftp`.
- It often contains additional components like a hostname, port, path, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.

#### **Examples of URLs:**
- `https://www.example.com/page`
- `ftp://files.example.com/resource.txt`
- `http://example.com?query=test`

### **Key Differences Between URI and URL**

| **Aspect**               | **URI**                                                                                     | **URL**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | A string that identifies a resource, either by name, location, or both.                     | A string that specifies the location of a resource and how to access it.                  |
| **Scope**                 | Broader: Includes URLs, URNs, and other identifiers.                                        | Narrower: A subset of URIs that specifically provide the location of a resource.          |
| **Purpose**               | Identification of a resource.                                                              | Location of a resource.                                                                   |
| **Components**            | May include a scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment (but not all are required).      | Must include a scheme (protocol) and location information (e.g., hostname, path).         |
| **Example**               | `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0` (URN), `https://example.com/resource` (URL)                    | `https://example.com/resource`                                                            |

### **Relationship Between URI and URL**
- **Every URL is a URI**, because it identifies a resource and provides its location.
- **Not every URI is a URL**, because some URIs (like URNs) only identify a resource by name, without specifying its location.

---

### **Analogy**
Think of a **URI** as a broader concept, like a "person's identity." A **URL** is more specific, like an "address" that tells you where to find the person.

---

### **Summary**
- **URI**: A general identifier for resources (can identify by name, location, or both).
- **URL**: A specific type of URI that identifies a resource by its location and provides a way to access it.

If you're working with web development or APIs, you'll typically encounter URLs more often.
