* providing only essential interface for 'outer world'.

## Abstraction
* Reduce complexity
* isolate the impact of changes
* Exposing the neccassary detail to user of the object
* decouple user from underlying implementation

## Inheritance
* Eliminate the redundant code
* open closed: open for exention

## Polymorphism
