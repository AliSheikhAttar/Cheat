#### Fan-In
- **Definition**: Fan-in is a concurrency pattern where multiple input channels are combined (or multiplexed) into a single output channel.
- **Purpose**: It allows data from multiple sources to be collected into one channel for unified processing.
- **Example**: The loop above is a fan-in pattern. Two channels (`input1` and `input2`) send their data to a single `output` channel. A single goroutine can then read from `output` to process all data, regardless of its source.
- **Use Case**: Merging logs from multiple services into a single stream for analysis.

Here’s a simplified visualization:
```
input1 ----\
            ---> output
input2 ----/
```

#### Fan-Out
- **Definition**: Fan-out is the opposite pattern, where data from a single input channel is distributed to multiple output channels or processing goroutines.
- **Purpose**: It enables parallel processing by splitting work across multiple workers.
- **Example**: Consider this code:

```go
input := make(chan int)
output1 := make(chan int)
output2 := make(chan int)

go func() {
    for val := range input {
        select {
        case output1 <- val:
        case output2 <- val:
        }
    }
}()

go worker1(output1) // worker1 processes data from output1
go worker2(output2) // worker2 processes data from output2
```

- **Explanation**: A goroutine reads from `input` and sends each value to either `output1` or `output2`, whichever is ready. Separate worker goroutines process data from `output1` and `output2` in parallel.
- **Alternative Approach**: Multiple goroutines could read directly from the same input channel:

```go
input := make(chan int)

worker1 := func() {
    for val := range input {
        // Process val
    }
}
worker2 := func() {
    for val := range input {
        // Process val
    }
}

go worker1()
go worker2()
```

Here, `worker1` and `worker2` compete for values from `input`, naturally distributing the work.
- **Use Case**: Distributing tasks (e.g., image processing) across multiple workers to speed up computation.

Visualization:
```
input ----> output1 ---> worker1
      ----> output2 ---> worker2
```

#### Key Differences
- **Fan-In**: Many-to-one (multiple inputs, one output).
- **Fan-Out**: One-to-many (one input, multiple outputs or workers).

Both patterns are powerful tools for managing data flow and parallelism in concurrent systems.

### Summary
- **First `select`**: The goroutine sends to one ready channel (chosen randomly if both are ready) and exits the `select`, not both.
- **Loop with `select`**: It merges `input1` and `input2` into `output`, running indefinitely, exemplifying fan-in.
- **Fan-In**: Combines multiple channels into one. **Fan-Out**: Distributes one channel’s data to multiple channels or workers.
