Yes, that's correct! In Go, the garbage collector (GC) runs **concurrently** with the program execution. This means the garbage collector does not block the entire program to do its job, allowing the program to continue running while GC cleans up memory in the background.

### How Does Go's GC Work Concurrently?

1. **Write Barriers**:
   - Go uses a **write barrier** mechanism to track memory changes during program execution.
   - A write barrier ensures that if the program modifies any references (pointers), the GC is aware of those changes and won't mistakenly collect memory that's still in use.

2. **Concurrent Mark-and-Sweep**:
   - **Mark Phase**: The GC starts from a root set (e.g., global variables, stack variables) and marks all reachable objects.
   - **Sweep Phase**: The GC reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer marked as reachable.
   - Both phases are designed to work concurrently with your code.

3. **Pauses Are Minimal**:
   - While some "stop-the-world" pauses are inevitable (e.g., to set up a new GC cycle or perform final cleanups), Go's GC is optimized to keep these pauses **extremely short**—in the range of microseconds, even for programs with gigabytes of memory.

4. **Multiple GC Workers**:
   - The garbage collector runs multiple worker threads alongside your program. The number of workers is proportional to the number of available CPU cores (managed by Go's runtime).

### What Happens During Program Execution?

Let’s look at a high-level timeline of what happens during runtime:

1. **Program Allocates Memory**:
   - When your code creates objects (e.g., slices, structs), memory is allocated on the heap.

2. **GC Observes and Tracks Memory**:
   - As the program runs, the GC keeps track of memory usage and changes using write barriers and runtime metadata.

3. **GC Detects Threshold**:
   - When the heap grows beyond a certain threshold, the GC starts a collection cycle.
   - The GC runs concurrently with your program to avoid long pauses.

4. **Concurrent GC Operations**:
   - GC identifies unused (unreachable) memory and reclaims it.
   - Your program continues executing with minimal disruption.

5. **Minimal Pauses**:
   - Small pauses occur to synchronize threads, but the GC is optimized to minimize these pauses.

### Visualizing Concurrent GC with an Example

Here’s an updated code example that visualizes the garbage collector running while the program is executing:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"time"
)

func allocateMemory() {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		_ = make([]int, 1_000_000) // Allocate a large slice
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // Simulate work
	}
	fmt.Println("Finished allocating memory")
}

func main() {
	go func() {
		for {
			time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
			fmt.Println("Program is still running...")
		}
	}()

	go allocateMemory()

	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		var memStats runtime.MemStats
		runtime.ReadMemStats(&memStats)
		fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v KB, GC Cycles = %v\n", memStats.Alloc/1024, memStats.NumGC)
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	}

	fmt.Println("Main program finished")
}
```

---

### Example Output:

```
Alloc = 200 KB, GC Cycles = 0
Program is still running...
Alloc = 203500 KB, GC Cycles = 1
Program is still running...
Alloc = 100 KB, GC Cycles = 2
Program is still running...
Alloc = 100 KB, GC Cycles = 3
Program is still running...
Main program finished
```

### Key Observations:
1. **GC Cycles**:
   - The `NumGC` counter increases each time the garbage collector completes a cycle.

2. **Concurrent Execution**:
   - While GC cycles run, the program continues executing (e.g., printing "Program is still running...").

3. **Memory Reclamation**:
   - You can see the memory (`Alloc`) grow during allocation and drop after GC reclaims unused objects.

### Why Concurrent GC Matters in Go?

- **Real-Time Applications**:
  - Since GC runs in the background, applications like web servers, databases, or real-time systems experience very little disruption, ensuring high responsiveness.
  
- **Efficient Use of Resources**:
  - By leveraging all CPU cores, GC can keep up with high allocation rates in multi-threaded programs.
