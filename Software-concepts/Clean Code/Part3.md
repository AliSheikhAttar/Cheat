## Switch Case
* Breaking down fat switch/case block into polymorphism dispatch
* create a derived class from each case and implement that case logic inside that class
* also implementing encapsulation, package data and method operating on that relevant data in the same class
 

## DRY Principle
* Don't repeat yourself

## Comments
* Don't write comments, re-write your code *Uncle Bob*
* Don't explain "whats" (obvious)
* Explain "Whys" and "Hows"
