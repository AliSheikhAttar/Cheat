## Switch Case
* Breaking down fat switch/case block into polymorphism dispatch
* create a derived class from each case and implement that case logic inside that class
* also implementing encapsulation, package data and method operating on that relevant data in the same class
 

## DRY Principle
* Don't repeat yourself

## Comments
* Don't write comments, re-write your code *Uncle Bob*
* Don't explain "whats" (obvious)
* Explain "Whys" and "Hows"

## Long methods
* methods longer than 10 lines
* methods specialize in one thing

## Cohesion Principle
* things that are related should be together
* things that are not related should not be together

## Single responsibility Principle
* A class/method should only do one thing and do it well
