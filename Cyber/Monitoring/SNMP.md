# SNMP

It can be used to collect detailed information about a device's running status, such as memory utilization, processor utilization, and the number of users connected. It can also collect information on the configuration and settings of the device.

It is used to manage and monitor network devices like routers, switches, servers, and printers. SNMP enables administrators to collect information about the device's status, performance, and configuration, typically by using a network management software that implements the SNMP protocol. 
The protocol defines how data is exchanged between the management systems and the monitored devices.

In order to use SNMP to monitor or manage a device, the device must have SNMP support, which most routers, switches, and printers do.

- SNMPv1 had little to no security and sent usernames and passwords in clear text.
- SNMPv2 improved upon the security.
- SNMPv3 is the most secure with encryption of credentials and use of security models to configure policies.
