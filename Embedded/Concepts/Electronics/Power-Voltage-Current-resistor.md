## what happnes when connecting dev board to external power supply?
* the external voltage to microcontroller via external power supply, go through a on-board voltage regulator which regulates it to 5v
* some component even require 3.3v, which is provided by an on board 3.3 voltage regulator derived from 5v supply.

## what happens if voltage doesnt get regulated?
Overvoltage harms components by exceeding their maximum voltage ratings, leading to excessive current, overheating, and ultimately causing permanent damage or failure.


## How linear regulator work
Unlike switching regulators, linear regulators reduce voltage by dissipating the excess energy as heat. For example, if you supply 12V, the regulator drops it down to 5V, resulting in a 7V difference that becomes heat.
Heat Dissipation: The regulator has a heatsink (often a simple metal tab) to help dissipate this heat. However, excessive heat from high input voltages or high current draws can lead to thermal shutdown or damage if not properly managed.


## How switching regulator work
Switching regulators control voltage by rapidly switching a transistor on and off at high frequencies. During the "on" phase, energy is stored in an inductor or capacitor, and during the "off" phase, this energy is released to the output. By precisely adjusting the ratio of the on and off times (duty cycle) based on feedback from the output voltage, switching regulators maintain a stable and efficient output voltage despite variations in input voltage or load conditions.


## Switching vs Linear regulator
- Switching Regulators:

Efficiency: Highly efficient (80-95%) by rapidly switching elements on and off.
Heat Generation: Produce less heat due to higher efficiency.
Complexity: More complex and expensive with potential electromagnetic noise.

- Linear Regulators:

Efficiency: Lower efficiency (typically 30-60%) as excess voltage is dissipated as heat.
Heat Generation: Generate more heat, requiring better thermal management.
Simplicity: Simpler, cheaper, and produce cleaner, noise-free output.

## Voltage Level Converter
A voltage level converter is an electronic device that safely shifts electrical signal levels between components operating at different voltages. It enables communication between devices with mismatched voltage requirements, such as interfacing a 5V microcontroller with 3.3V sensors. These converters prevent damage to sensitive electronics by ensuring compatible voltage levels. They are essential in mixed-voltage systems, including modern microcontrollers, sensors, and communication modules.

## TTL Level
TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) level refers to a standard for digital signal voltages used in many electronic circuits. In TTL logic, a voltage between **0V and 0.8V** is considered a logical LOW, while **2V to 5V** is recognized as a logical HIGH. TTL levels are widely used in microcontrollers, digital circuits, and communication interfaces. They ensure consistent and reliable signal interpretation across various digital devices.
