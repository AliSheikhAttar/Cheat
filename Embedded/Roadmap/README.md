# Roadmap

## STAGE 0

* C/C++ Fundementals
* Assembly
* Tools & IDEs - Compiler, Linker, Debugger, Eclipse, VS Code, Keil, MPLAB, Arduino IDE
* Electronics Fundementals
* Microcontroller (Architecture & Programming) - ARM Cortex-M, AVR, or PIC. Practice writing drivers and low-level code


## STAGE 1

* Projects 
  - Arduino, Raspberry Pi
  - GPIO interfacing, Analog Sensors interfacing, Multiple Peripherals, Collaborative, Sleep Modes
* Debuggin tools - JTAG, SWD, Logic analyzer
* Embedded Protocols - UART, RS232, RS485, I2C, SPI
* Memory Management, stack, heap, memory mapping, direct memory access


## STAGE 2

* Advanced C/C++
* RTOS 
  - Poating, Task management, Scheduling, Priority Inversion, Context Switching, Synchronization & Deadlocks, Inter-process/tasks Communication, Real-time Analysis
  - Start with a popular RTOS like FreeRTOS, VxWorks, or RTEMS. Study its architecture, API, and system calls
  - Implement RTOS-based Projects: Develop applications where real-time performance is critical. Focus on multi-threading, task management, and inter-task communication.
  - Master Real-Time Scheduling: Understand different scheduling algorithms like Round-Robin, Priority-based, and Rate Monotonic scheduling.
* Peripheral Interfacing - ADC, DAC, PWM, DMA
* Wireless Communication - BLE, Wi-Fi


## STAGE 3
* Hardware-Software Integration: Study how to optimize software to run efficiently on embedded hardware, including power management, interrupt handling, and real-time constraints.
* Communication Protocols: Master protocols commonly used in embedded systems, such as CAN, Ethernet, USB, and wireless communication (Bluetooth, Zigbee).
* Security in Embedded Systems: Learn about securing embedded systems, including cryptography, secure boot, and encryption methods.
* IoT and Embedded Linux: Explore the Internet of Things (IoT) and work on embedded Linux systems like Yocto or Buildroot for more complex devices.
